                                I became acutely aware of the cost of healthcare at an early age. When I was in seventh grade, my father worked two jobs, and my mother had a poorly paid job – both worked at night. Because both of my parents were working, I bicycled to catechism class at my church which was only a few miles away, but when it was time to bicycle home, it was already dark. I crashed my bicycle and broke my arm on my way home from catechism class. With my broken arm tucked into my jacket zipper as a makeshift sling, I walked the rest of the way pushing my bike with my unbroken arm. Since my parents were at work, I called my grandmother when I got home, and she took me to a hospital near her house. My father’s employer-sponsored HMO did not cover the emergency room visit asserting that the hospital was out of network. For the next two months, I heard my parents fighting at night about money due to the cost of me going to the emergency room while I laid awake with my arm in a cast. Hearing my parents fight about the money that they did not have despite having three jobs among them indelibly taught me that Americans need to be able to see doctors and get medical attention without worrying about whether insurance will pay. Families should not suffer financial hardship because their children have bicycle accidents. As a preteen, I recognized the desperate need for all Americans to have access to healthcare. Thirty years later, the solution had a title: Medicare for All.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 2019, Congresswoman Jayapal (D-WA) introduced HR 1384 commonly referred to as the Medicare for All Act or M4A, a bill similar to S 1804, the 2017 bill introduced by Senator Sanders (I-VT) that would have given access to health insurance to all United States citizens. In 2021, 2022, 2023 and April 2025, both Jayapal and Sanders reintroduced the similar bills (HR 3069 and S 1655 in April 2025). In my opinion, passingPassing the 2025 bill would have been the a monumental win legislative pinnacle of American domestic policy of the past half centuryfor Americans, but due to Republican and non-progressive Democratic opposition, neither the House nor the Senate voted for the Medicare for All bill. The bill had despite havingsignificant supporting, including 106 cosponsors in the House and 15 in the Ssenate. I believe that the Medicare for All bills should be revised, updated and brought forth for a vote in both chambers of the US Congress; Americans are ready for universal access to healthcare.

                                In the final months of 2025, we watched Congress shut down over an inability to fund the Affordable Care Act with enhanced subsidies consistent with the COVID-19 relief measures enacted a half decade ago. Thisee showdown on healthcare showdown not only shut down the United States government in 2025 but led to the dramatic events of January 2026 where Congresswoman Taylor Greene, (a congresswoman for with whom I generally disagree but applaud her 2025 have little sympathy but applaud her efforts in 2025 to address the loss ofto fund enhanced subsidies) , left Congress., and the House , with bipartisan support,The US House of Representatives circumvented Speaker Johnson&#39;s refusal to put enhanced subsidies to a vote and passed enhanced subsidy legislation with a 230-196 bipartisan vote on January 8, 2026. The bipartisan initiative shows that. In my opinion, the recent livelyAmericans are ready for a change. We need to get past debate concerning enhanced subsidies for the Affordable Care Act demonstrates that America is ready to seriously considerand startto providing provide access to healthcare and health insurance to all Americans despite previous opposition.

                                If I am elected by the people of Philadelphia to represent them in Congress, I will make it a priority to champion a path that ensures all Americans have healthcare coverage. Whether by enacting the Medicare for All Act or something better, at this time,I promisecommit to help provideing healthcare access to all Americans is of paramount importance to me.

                Working people deserve pay that keeps up with the cost of living. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at
                <strong>$7.25 since 2009</strong>—and that’s not a livable wage in Philadelphia.

                  <p><strong>Fight for $15</strong></p>

                  <p>
                    Historically speaking, the federal minimum wage had the most buying power. Despite American workers increasing productivity exponentially since the 1970’s, the federal minimum wage has stagnated and the purchasing power has plummeted. It is clear that the federal minimum wage is no longer a minimum wage, but rather it is a poverty wage. The federal minimum wage has not changed since 2009, and it remains $7.25 per hour. There are no exceptions for tipped workers, or workers with disabilities. It is also important to mention that the minimum wage is not tied to inflation and has not kept up with the cost of living. I would argue that it is impossible to live off of the minimum wage in any state in America, but it is particularly impossible to live in Philadelphia more than $7.25 per hour. This needs to change.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The fight for a $15 minimum wage has its roots in organized labor, and in the struggles of workers to be able to live off of their wages. I have been a union member and steward, and I believe that unions and organized labor are a key part of the fight for higher wages and better benefits. In 2016, I became an employer and raised the starting wage to at least $15 per hour. I did this because I believed it was the right thing to do, and I believed that workers deserve to be paid a living wage. In 2017, I raised the minimum wage to $17 per hour. In 2018, I raised the minimum wage to $18 per hour, and in 2019, I raised the minimum wage to $19 per hour. I did this because I believe in paying people fairly, and I believe that a higher wage is beneficial for workers, their families, and the overall economy. My business benefited from lower turnover, higher morale, increased productivity, and an overall growth in both top-line revenue and net profit.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    My support for the fight for a $15 minimum wage is more than simply a moral imperative. The fight for a $15 minimum wage is also an economic imperative. Low-wage workers and unskilled workers bear the brunt of low wages for a few reasons.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Many low-income workers are essentially subsidized by the Earned Income Tax Credit, SNAP benefits, or other social welfare programs. This means that taxpayers are subsidizing corporations that pay their workers poverty wages. For example, Walmart is the largest employer in America, and it is also the largest recipient of social welfare programs. This means that taxpayers are subsidizing Walmart’s employees. Walmart should be paying Walmart’s employees. The same can be said for Amazon. Amazon should be paying Amazon's employees.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    There is a second way in which the fight for a $15 minimum wage is also an economic imperative. When the minimum wage is low, it creates a drag on the economy. Workers have less money to spend, which means less money is circulating in local economies. This also means that workers have less money to invest in their education, their health, and their families. A higher wage would allow workers to have more money to spend, which would stimulate local economies and create a healthier economy overall. It would also allow workers to invest in their future and their families.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For the reasons I have enumerated in this policy statement and many more, I am proud to join the fight for a $15 minimum wage.
