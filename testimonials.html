						<span class="t-quote-strong">My name is Derrick Zhang, and I’m proud to stand here in support of Shaun Griffith for Congress.</span>
						I first met Shaun as my tax professional. What started as a professional relationship quickly grew into something much more. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to truly get to know him — not just as an intelligent and capable professional, but as a man of character. Today, I’m proud to call him my friend.
						<br>
						Shaun is one of the hardest working people I know. He approaches every challenge with focus, discipline, and a commitment to getting it right. But what really sets him apart isn’t just his intelligence — it’s his integrity.
						<br>
						He is honest, even when it’s difficult. He is passionate about doing the right thing, even when it’s not popular. And he is selfless — always willing to put others first.
						<br>
						Shaun has always been a voice for the voiceless. He listens. He cares. And he believes that leadership is about service, not status. That’s exactly the kind of person we need representing us.
						<br>
						I fully and wholeheartedly support Shaun’s candidacy for Congress because I know his heart, I know his work ethic, and I know his commitment to doing what’s right for our community.

						<span class="t-quote-strong">I owe my introduction to tax to Shaun.</span>
						Honestly, I don't remember applying for the tax internship at his office, but when I was called for an interview, I decided to go. That single decision changed everything. Shaun gave me my first-ever job in tax, and he didn't just hire me for one season; he believed in me enough to bring me back every single tax season after that while I finished my degree at La Salle. That consistent support and real-world experience were invaluable.
						<br>
						That internship with Shaun was the foundation for everything that followed. It directly led me to where I am today, working full-time at KPMG. But more than just giving me a job, Shaun showed me what it means to be a true professional and entrepreneur. He's incredibly ambitious and knowledgeable, not just about tax, but about how to genuinely help people. He treats his clients and his community with real care and dedication. Supporting Shaun isn't just about politics for me; it's about supporting someone who has personally invested in the success of others. I am so happy to support him in this next chapter of service.

						As a business owner Shaun was a visionary leader who inspired and motivated his employees to achieve new personal goals while focusing on the goals of the business. Shaun was always forward thinking and had the ability to translate a strategy into action. I am not surprised at his decision to become an elected official to represent the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania's third Congressional District. He is cool, comfortable and confident in his background of service to the many diverse communities he has worked in and with. I believe Shaun's ideas and concerns should be shared and supported. I know given the opportunity Shaun will execute his position with honesty and integrity.

					<p class="t-quote-text">I strongly support Shaun Griffith because I believe in most of the issues he cares about. I also know that to get a job done, it must be done with dedication and hard work. Both of these are strength Shaun has developed from an early age. Shaun is not afraid to listen to what people need. He also does not shy away from hearing the suggestions of others. He recognizes team work often is necessary to accomplish a task. Shaun has been a hard worker for years. A person who cares about the needs of others. He would go out of his way to help those in need. He is dependable. He has a strong sense of right verses wrong. I think he would be a valuable asset to The US Congress.</p>

His honesty and expertise as a lawyer and accountant, along with his commitment to his clients, is rare in these two industries often rife with corruption. I am honored to be able to support Shaun in his bid to represent this great city in Congress.</p>
