					<h2 class="news-headline">PA man turns down $15 million to turn farm into data center</h2>
					<p class="news-statement">
						This is a short article, but it touches on many points relevant to the data center debate. First, it shows how much money data center operators are willing to spend - apparently more than double the market value for this farmland according to this article. Second, it shows how environmental classicism comes into play; this article mentions how some townships have raised real estate taxes to keep data centers out. While I commend the municipality's dedication to preserving the natural landscape, not all residents of all townships can afford higher real estate taxes to stop data center development, and working class neighborhoods may suffer. Third, I commend this owner for his dedication to preserving farmland. Agriculture impacts the environment more than any other industry. One of the main concerns is that any agricultural land that is displaced for data center construction will almost certainly result in ruination of forests, wetlands or other ecosystems that may be used to replace displaced farmland. Preserving existing farmland is essential to curbing greenhouse emissions and preserving forests and wetlands.

					<h2 class="news-headline">Hundreds of millionaires and billionaires sign open letter demanding higher taxes on the super-rich</h2>
					<p class="news-statement">
						At the core of the the Trump's message lies a irreconcilable inconsistency. In both 2016 and 2024, he campaigned on standing up for workers and making things more affordable. Macroeconomically speaking, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 have accelerated the wealth gap and made the rich richer and the working class poorer. Since America amended the US Constitution in 1913 to allow federal income taxes, Amendment 16, the government's primary means of influencing the economy has been the Internal Revenue Code. When America had marginal tax rates of 70% and higher, America enjoyed greater income and wealth equality than it had before (e.g., the Gilded Age) or since Reagan's supply-side economics (i.e., our present unsustainable quagmire). George Bush was right in the 1980 Republican primary when he called supply-side economics "voodoo;" cutting taxes on the wealthy in hopes of their gains trickling down to us commoners is superstition, not intuition. Both times Donald Trump entered the Whitehouse, he colluded with Congress to widen the wealth gap by passing tax laws that compel middle-class professionals, skilled artisans and working-class laborers to pay for the wealthy oligarchs' surpluses. Government cannot earnestly talk about affordability until it raises the marginal tax rates of individuals and the corporations. Want to know more about tax proposal that could improve affordability? If so, ask us. I would love to share my thoughts on how to write the tax code to help working Americans. As a member of the US Tax Court since 2005 who has advised thousands of businesses and individuals on income tax, I have dozens of ideas of how to rewrite the tax code to help workers.

					<h2 class="news-headline">Army vet detained by ICE for 8 hours says he wasn't allowed to call an attorney</h2>
					<p class="news-statement">
						Agents of the Trump Administration violate Americans' civil liberties daily. Violating Americans' civil rights and due process rights is always reprehensible, but this instance additionally unveils the reality of the right-wing false narrative that the Trump administration respects our veterans and our brave men and women who serve in uniform. The truth is that ICE disrespects veterans as much as it disrespects all other Americans. If elected, I will work to hold the executive branch accountable for its violations of constitutional rights, defund ICE and work to reduce executive authority.

					<h2 class="news-headline">Report: Fighting Rising Tide Of Authoritarianism Sounds Like A Lot Of Work</h2>
					<p class="news-statement">
						A few weeks ago on Breaking Points, journalist Ryan Grim @DropSiteNews, cofounder of Drop Site News, quipped that if you want to read the real news, read the Onion. A few days later, the Onion published this satirical commentary on why preserving liberal democracy is so challenging. If you want to know the difference between me and other Democrats running in the May 19, 2026 primary for the Pennsylvania 3<sup>rd</sup> Congressional seat, the difference is - in part - my long commitment to preserving liberal democracy. In high school and college in the 1990s, I was with protesters opposing Klan activity in Westmoreland County, PA and later in Cicero, IL. In the late 90s, I stood with Dolores Huerta chanting, "¡Sí se puede!" and "¡Abajo al Racismo!" outside of sweatshops in Chicago. As the president of the Environmental Law Society at the University of San Francisco School of Law in the early 2000s, I coordinated with law school students in the San Francisco Bay Area to protest developers challenge zoning permits for new single family unit developments to encourage smart, i.e., ecologically sustainable, land development that would make housing more affordable. Now, we Americans face the most immediate threat to civil liberties since Japanese internment 80 years ago. Just like 80 years ago, our government is conducting unwarranted searches and seizures and arresting people without showing probable cause. The government is deporting people with no legal due process. We must be more active. Attend "No Kings" and "Ice Out" Rallies. Write or call your legislators and ask them to defund ICE. Vote for progressives.
