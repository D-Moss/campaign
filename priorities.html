                                I became acutely aware of the cost of healthcare at an early age. When I was in seventh grade, my father worked two jobs, and my mother had a poorly paid job – both worked at night. Because both of my parents were working, I bicycled to catechism class at my church which was only a few miles away, but when it was time to bicycle home, it was already dark. I crashed my bicycle and broke my arm on my way home from catechism class. With my broken arm tucked into my jacket zipper as a makeshift sling, I walked the rest of the way pushing my bike with my unbroken arm. Since my parents were at work, I called my grandmother when I got home, and she took me to a hospital near her house. My father’s employer-sponsored HMO did not cover the emergency room visit asserting that the hospital was out of network. For the next two months, I heard my parents fighting at night about money due to the cost of me going to the emergency room while I laid awake with my arm in a cast. Hearing my parents fight about the money that they did not have despite having three jobs among them indelibly taught me that Americans need to be able to see doctors and get medical attention without worrying about whether insurance will pay. Families should not suffer financial hardship because their children have bicycle accidents. As a preteen, I recognized the desperate need for all Americans to have access to healthcare. Thirty years later, the solution had a title: Medicare for All.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 2019, Congresswoman Jayapal (D-WA) introduced HR 1384 commonly referred to as the Medicare for All Act or M4A, a bill similar to S 1804, the 2017 bill introduced by Senator Sanders (I-VT) that would have given access to health insurance to all United States citizens. In 2021, 2022, 2023 and April 2025, both Jayapal and Sanders reintroduced similar bills (HR 3069 and S 1655 in April 2025). Passing the 2025 bill would have been a monumental win for Americans, but due to Republican and non-progressive Democratic opposition, neither the House nor the Senate voted for the Medicare for All bill. The bill had significant supporting, including 106 cosponsors in the House and 15 in the Senate. Medicare for All bills should be updated and brought forth for a vote in both chambers of the US Congress; Americans are ready for universal access to healthcare.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In the final months of 2025, Congress shut down over an inability to fund the Affordable Care Act with enhanced subsidies consistent with the COVID-19 relief measures enacted a half decade ago. The showdown on healthcare led to the dramatic events of January 2026 where Congresswoman Taylor Greene, a congresswoman with whom I generally disagree but applaud her 2025 efforts to fund enhanced subsidies, left Congress. The US House of Representatives circumvented Speaker Johnson's refusal to put enhanced subsidies to a vote and passed enhanced subsidy legislation with a 230-196 bipartisan vote on January 8, 2026. The bipartisan initiative shows that Americans are ready provide access to healthcare and health insurance.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If I am elected by the people of Philadelphia to represent them in Congress, I will make it a priority to champion a path that ensures all Americans have healthcare coverage. Whether by enacting the Medicare for All Act or something better, I commit to help providing healthcare access to all Americans.

                        Working people deserve pay that keeps up with the cost of living. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at
                        <strong>$7.25 since 2009</strong>—and that’s not a livable wage in Philadelphia.
                    </p>

                    <p class="policy-summary">
                        I support a <strong>$15 minimum wage</strong> because it strengthens families, reduces the pressure on public assistance programs, and makes sure corporations pay the true cost of labor—not workers and the middle class.

                            <p><strong>Fight for $15</strong></p>

                            <p>
                                Adjusted for inflation, the current minimum wage has approximately half as much buying power as the minimum wage had from 1967 to 1972. Meantime, American workers have increased productivity exponentially over the past 50 years. Now, American workers are essentially compensated half as much for twice as much output. Simply to keep up with inflation, the federal minimum wage should be doubled.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The minimum wage has not changed since 2009, and it remains $7.25 per hour. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania follows the federal minimum wage; therefore, Philadelphia employers are not legally required to pay workers more than $7.25 per hour. This needs to change, and organized labor started the fight for a $15 minimum wage more than a decade ago. As a former member of two labor unions, to wit, AFSCME and SEIU, and as a former union steward of SEIU, I support the fight for a $15 minimum wage. As a member of the US House of Representatives, I will fight for a $15 federal minimum wage and demand a floor vote on it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I personally adopted the fight for higher wages in 2016 when I supported Senator Bernard Sanders (I-VT) in his primary bid for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. As the majority shareholder and operations manager of USA Tax Service, I could not reconcile my support of the Sanders’s candidacy with my own failure to pay some of my employees at least $15 per hour. I took a leap of faith in 2016 and raised all employees’ wages to at least $15 per hour. Higher wages improved employee retention which obviously increased employee effectiveness. More effective employees led to better client retention. The increase in labor was more than offset by a decrease in marketing, recruiting and training. Based on my success, I would encourage all employers who currently employee people at a rate lower than $15 per hour to try raising their employees’ wages. I bet employers will enjoy the benefits of happier staff, better retention of skilled workers, higher client satisfaction and an overall growth in both top-line revenue and net profit.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I believe that middle-class workers and professionals will benefit from a higher minimum as much as low-wage workers. Because I have worked in the income tax industry for over two decades, I have concluded that the beneficiaries of the deflated minimum wage are large corporations that employ many people but pay them very little. The true victims of the deflated minimum wage are not only the workers who are paid little; low wages hurt everyone who punches a timecard. After reviewing tens of thousands of income tax returns, I am certain that middle-class workers and white-collar professionals pay for low wages while oligarchs amass the benefits.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Many low-income workers are essentially subsidized by the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, i.e., the refundable child tax credit, and myriad other programs. To the extent that these programs help needy people, I support them, but middle-class workers and white-collar professionals pay the bulk of federal income tax that provide most of the funding for these programs. The depressed minimum wage has created an economic system where large companies do not pay the full cost of their labor; skilled laborers and middle-income professionals pay most of the federal income tax that fund the refundable tax credits that supplement low-wage workers’ income. Basically, the low minimum wage compels middle-class taxpayers to pay for the labor that benefits the ultrarich. Amazon and Walmart should be paying their employees better wages; I and other middle-class taxpayers should not be picking up the slack for corporate behemoths like Amazon and Walmart.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There is a second way in which the fight for a $15 minimum wage directly affects middle-income earners. When the minimum wage is only $7.25 per hour, it is difficult for skilled employees to negotiate higher wages with their employers. Raising the minimum wage would provide middle-class employees and labor union organizers more leverage to negotiate higher wages and better benefit for skilled labor.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For the reasons I have enumerated in this policy statement, I am proud to join the fight for a $15 minimum wage.

                                Having grown up on land that had been my grandfather and great-grandfather&#39;s dairy farm in Western Pennsylvania with well water and no public infrastructure for potable water, I witnessed the adverse environmental impacts of unregulated commerce first-hand. When I was very young, my paternal grandfather died from lung disease, possibly Farmer&#39;s Lung, a disease that affects farmers akin to how Black Lung affects coal miners. As early as kindergarten, I knew that agriculture, though vitally important, impacts local ecosystems and the people who rely on them. Seven miles away from where my paternal grandfather died of lung disease, my maternal grandmother later died of cancer of many varieties – stomach, brain and bone marrow. Although I don&#39;t know for certain, I personally believe her myriad cancers were precipitated by her well water that was spoiled by an unregulated trash dump near the farm that that once belong to my mother&#39;s ancestors. These personal losses directly influenced my passion for environmental oversight.

                                In the 19 th and early 20 th centuries, the economy of Western Pennsylvania relied on Bituminous coal mining. Due to oxidation from nearby coal mines, the aquifer that supplied water to my family’s well produced red, rusty water which was unfit for cooking and drinking – probably even bathing. At great expense to them, my parents had to drill a second well that was much deeper when I was in elementary school. In the 1980s, my father worked as a social worker and my mother worked at nearby hotels cleaning rooms for about $1.25 per room; consequently, our family did not have the financial resources to drill a new well, but our safety required clean water. Drilling the deeper well financially burdened my parents for years.

                                While a law student, I was the president of the Environmental Law Society and interned with the United States Army Corps of Engineers where I liaised with the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency to prosecute polluters of the San Francisco Bay. I have cared about environmental protection since childhood and worked on environmental regulation since 2000.

                                Historically speaking, both Republicans and Democrats have stewarded the environment; environmental oversight became bitterly partisan mostly in the past two and a half decades. Before becoming the essential Bull Moose, Republican Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act of 1906 that recognized the need to preserve natural resources and empowered the federal government to establish National Monuments. With bipartisan support in both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, Congress overruled Richard Nixon’s veto of the Clean Water Act in 1972. Democratic President Lyndon B Johnson initially signed the Clean Air Act into law in 1967, and Republican George H. W. Bushed endorsed the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act that effectively ended acid rain. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act a/k/a Superfund, was signed into law by Democrat Jimmy Carter, but the first Superfund projects commenced under Republican Ronald Reagan.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In the early 2000s, the Overton window shifted, and the narrative adopted a decidedly libertarian tone. Since then, opponents of the environment have run up the score. Carbon offsetting, the right-wing environmental position regarding greenhouse emissions of the 1990s, became the legislative standard pushing out the 1990s left-wing position, i.e., carbon emissions elimination, altogether. Simultaneously, Republicans have significantly weakened the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act with financial backing from the fossil fuel industry. There has not been a Superfund project approved since Donald Trump returned to the Whitehouse in January 2025.
                            </p>

                                Over the past decade, new environmental concerns have arisen that materially and detrimentally impact Americans. For example, we now know that microplastics exist in all water on Earth and in the atmosphere around the Earth. Likewise, we now know that PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) may last forever. While enviros like me have been losing political and legislative battles for years, new battlefronts have emerged.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Despite the many environmental threats, there is hope. In early 2019, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Senator Edward Markey (D-MA) introduced the Green New Deal. Although the framework was non-binding, its tenets directly influenced President Joe’s Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 demonstrated through various subsidies and initiatives that green energy sources were economically viable.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As a Representative in the US House, I will fight for carbon sequestration, methane and other greenhouse gas reduction, PFAS regulation and plastic reduction. I will work to create careers in green industries that provide American workers financial stability and professional dignity. In sum, I will join Representative Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Markey to reintroduce the Green New Deal, but this time, it will not be a non-binding resolution. I will work to make the Green New Deal binding law.
                            </p>
